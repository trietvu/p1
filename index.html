			<h3>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h3>
			<p>
				You might say that I'm the unlikely web developer. I come from a family of doctors and was headed that way myself until I decided that it wasn't what I wanted.<br><br>
				So with a worthless degree, I began my search for a career which started in advertising and graphic design and eventually led me to web development. I worked in various jobs learning HTML, CSS and enough programming to function within my position and even started my first company in 1998 based on a contract with a national company.<br><br>
				I'm currently on my second company which I started 10 years ago. I manage infrastructure, deal with clients/partners and oversee the "big picture."
			</p>

			<h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
			<p>I realized a few years ago that in order to accomplish what I'd like to do in my career, I would need to formalize my CV and education beyond mere experience. So much of what I know comes from problem solving within the projects or working scenarios that I face during the work day. It puts me at a disadvantage with those that have studied programming and technology in an academic setting.  I hope that this course is the beginnning of a master's degree that will allow me to transition to the next step in my career path.</p>
			<hr class="separator">
			<h3>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
			<p>As I mentioned above, all of my experience with programming has come from the workplace. I started with HTML and CSS in the late 1990s and dabbled in C++. I took a position with a dot com in 2003 which allowed me to learn and work in ColdFusion. In 2006, I worked began working with PHP and MySQL. I usually didn't write the code myself but helped troubleshoot issues within it which did require a certain level of understanding.</p>
			<hr class="separator">
			<h3>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
			<p>I work almost entirely on a PC because it's easier to understand what's happening with my programmers and partners, if they should have problems. I do, however, have a Macintosh computer as well.  It's mostly for beta-testing though.</p>
			<hr class="separator">
			<h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
			<p>Programming is definitely not an area that I've dedicated a great deal of time to learn but I'm a good problem-solver. Given enough time, I'll find a solution. I spent a few years as a consultant for some national and regional clients in streamlining their business models and developing IA. I'm an "ideas guy" but not in the sense of coming up with new and original ideas. I repurpose ideas and make them useful or profitable.</p>
